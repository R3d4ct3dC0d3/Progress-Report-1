Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I bought the furby and took out its insides and then attempted to rewire it, I was not able to get the soldering to make the furby work with the Arduino, because of this I have to switch to plan B of making an RPG 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

Work on the RPG

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Essentially everything involving taking the furby apart, I severely underestimated the amount of non-coding work that would be involved with even getting this project off of the ground.
